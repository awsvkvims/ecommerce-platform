# AI Usage Rules

This project may use AI assistance for learning and scaffolding.

Rules:
1. AI is used to generate scaffolding and boilerplate only.
2. AI explanations are preferred before code generation.
3. No code is committed without understanding it.
4. All AI-generated code must be reviewed before commit.
5. Learning and correctness take priority over speed.
